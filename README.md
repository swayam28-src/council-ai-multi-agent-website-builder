# Council of High Intelligence (v0 Clone)

This is a simple, highly readable multi-agent system designed to teach 2nd and 3rd year students how AI orchestration and agentic workflows operate in Python.

It mimics the functionality of `v0.dev` or `lovable.dev` by:

1. Taking a raw user prompt.
2. Spinning up a council of 5 agents (PM, Designer, Security, Interviewer, Plan Generator) to debate the idea in a live group chat.
3. Using a 6th agent (Coding Agent) to write the final HTML, CSS, and JS.
4. Rendering the final output live in an `iframe`.

## How to run:

1. Navigate to this directory in your terminal.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   **Windows**

   ```bash
   .\venv\scripts\activate
   ```

   **macOS / Linux**

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file in the project root containing:

   ```env
   MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key
   ```
5. Run the FastAPI server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
6. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

## Architecture overview for Students

* `main.py`: Contains the FastAPI backend and the core Agent Orchestration loop. Read the `agent_loop` function to see how Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream the AI's thoughts back to the browser in real-time.
* `static/index.html`: The HTML structure of the page.
* `static/style.css`: The styling.
* `static/script.js`: Contains the JavaScript that connects to the Python SSE stream and dynamically updates the UI.
